# Focus: HOPE Analytics

## Description
This project will analyze data from Focus: HOPE, a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, Michigan. The nonprofit combats racism, poverty, and injustice through its workforce development programs, educational support, food assistance, and community engagement. 

### Personal Interest
My family has volunteered at Focus: HOPE for quite some time, and recently, my brother started a club at his school, the Stoney Creek Focus: HOPE Club, where students can attend monthly events at the Focus: HOPE warehouse, packing boxes of food for impoverished seniors. As my family's involvement has increased, we've had the opportunity to build meaningful connections and attend more events, including Eleanor's Celebration of Hope. These experiences have truly deepened my commitment to making a meaningful difference in the world, even if that impact is more subtle.
